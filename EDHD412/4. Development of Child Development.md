### **The Development of Child Development**

- **20th Century**: Increased reliance on professionals for parenting advice, with pediatricians emerging in the 1930s/1940s.
    
- **Key Figures in Child Development**:
    
    - **G. Stanley Hall**: Introduced scientific study of child development in the US, using questionnaires to understand children's thinking and teachers' perceptions.
    - **James Mark Baldwin**: Explored motor development and discovered stages of development, influencing Piaget and Vygotsky's theories.
    - **John B. Watson**: Advocated for behaviorism, focusing on observable behavior in infants to understand basic emotions and personality development. Known for the Little Albert study, which was discussed in class.
- **Child Research Institutes**: Established in the 1920s/1930s at universities to research and share findings on child development.
    
- **Infant-Caregiver Attachment**:
    
    - **Ainsworth's Strange Situation**: A method to study attachment by observing infants' reactions to separation and reunion with caregivers.
    - **Harlow's Monkey Studies**: Explored attachment through experiments with monkeys, raising questions about the generalizability to human infants.

### **Research Methods (Continued from Class 3)**

- **Validity**:
    
    - **External Validity**: Concerns about generalizing findings, e.g., applying a US study's results in Malaysia.
    - **Internal Validity**: Ensuring changes in dependent variables are due to independent variables.
- **Research Designs**:
    
    - **Longitudinal**: Follows the same subjects over time, useful for tracking development and intervention effects but prone to attrition and practice effects.
    - **Cross-Sectional**: Compares different age groups at one time, efficient but can't distinguish between age-related and cohort effects.
    - **Microgenetic**: Intensive observation over a short period to understand developmental processes, with rich data but limited generalizability.

### **Research Measures for Studying Infants**

- **Involuntary Responses**: Measures like heart rate, cortisol levels, and EEG.
- **Visual Measures**: Fixation, preference, habituation/dishabituation.
- **Conditioned Behavior**: Techniques like head-turning for rewards.
- **Parental Reports**: Diaries, checklists, rating scales, questionnaires.
- **Archival Research**: Analysis of historical records like census data, childcare manuals.

### **Issues with Studying Infants**

- **Behavioral State**: Newborns have different arousal levels, often sleeping 16-17 hours/day.
- **Inference and Interpretation**: Interpreting infant behavior, like longer looking times at unexpected events.
- **Ethical Concerns**: Challenges with informed consent.
- **Diversity of Participants**: Ensuring a diverse sample.
