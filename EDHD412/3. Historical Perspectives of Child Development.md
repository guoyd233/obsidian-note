### **Historical Perspectives of Child Development**

- **Ancient Views**:
    
    - In Ancient Greece and Rome, infant boys were inspected for health to determine their value as future fighters. Unhealthy infants were often killed.
    - Infanticide was common until laws protecting infants began around 100 CE.
    - High infant mortality rates in medieval Europe (300-500 per 1000 live births) compared to modern rates (5.547 in the US).
- **Infant Abandonment**:
    
    - Often due to illness or to reduce heirs among the wealthy. Changes in inheritance laws affected infant mortality rates.
- **Renaissance to 19th Century**:
    
    - Babies were sometimes left at churches, leading to the establishment of orphanages and children's hospitals.
    - Puritans viewed infants as conceived in sin but valued breastfeeding, which inadvertently lowered infant mortality by passing on antibodies.
- **19th Century & Beyond**:
    
    - Scientific professionals began advising on infant care. Milk stations provided guidance on hygiene and feeding.
    - The Progressive Movement led to the establishment of the US Children's Bureau to address child welfare.
- **Family Life Changes**:
    
    - European immigrants had children in their late teens to early 40s, but family sizes were not large due to high IMR.
    - Families of slaves were often separated, with lasting effects post-slavery.
    - Industrial Revolution and Baby Boom influenced family sizes and parenting practices.

### **Research Methods**

- **Research Settings**:
    
    - **Naturalistic**: Observations in real-life settings like schools or homes. Requires clear operational definitions and consideration of observer bias.
    - **Laboratory**: Controlled environments at universities, focusing on variables, internal, and external validity.
- **Validity**:
    
    - **External Validity**: Generalizability of findings.
    - **Internal Validity**: Ensuring changes in dependent variables are due to independent variables.
- **Research Designs**:
    
    - **Case Study/Single-Subject Research**: In-depth study of one individual, often used as a starting point for broader research.
    - **Quasi-Experimental**: Compares pre-existing groups, useful for ethical or practical reasons where random assignment isn't possible.
    - **Experimental**: Involves random assignment, providing high internal validity but potentially lower external validity.

### **Practice Examples**:

- **Case Study**: Documenting the effects of prenatal music exposure on a single child.
- **Quasi-Experimental**: Comparing twins raised in different environments (same household vs. different adoptive families).
- **Experimental**: Randomly assigning newborns to groups to test the effect of music on eye gaze.
