### **Why Study Infancy?**

- **Significant Transformations**: Over the first three years, infants undergo huge changes in:
    - Speech & language
    - Motor skills (e.g., walking)
    - Physical growth
    - Emotional development and relationships
- **Long-term Impact**: Experiences in these early years have lasting effects on an individual's life.
- **Developmental Stages vs. Continuous Development**:
    - **Stages**: Development occurs in qualitatively different stages.
    - **Continuous**: Development is seen as a gradual process with subtle changes.
    - Perspective can vary based on the observer and frequency of observation.

### **Nature vs. Nurture**

- **Nature**: Development influenced by genetics and heredity.
    - Advances in technology allow deeper insights into genetic influences.
- **Nurture**: Development shaped by upbringing and environmental experiences.
    - Involves multiple interacting influences.

### **Epigenesis**

- Interaction of genes with each other and the environment to produce developmental outcomes.
    - Some seemingly prewired aspects can be influenced by experiences.

### **Normal & Atypical Development**

- Development varies among children but can still be considered normal.
- Atypical development can occur in physical, cognitive, or social domains.
- Discussion on parental reactions to developmental milestones.
