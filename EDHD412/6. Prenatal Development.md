### **Prenatal Development**

- **Historical Perspectives**: Until the 19th century, fetuses were thought to be miniature humans that only grew in size. Various myths about preventing miscarriages and defects existed.
    
- **Pregnancy Overview**:
    
    - **Trimesters 孕期**: Pregnancy is divided into three equal trimesters, lasting 280 days from the last menstrual period or 266 days from conception.
    - **Gestation 孕期计算**: Medical professionals count from the last menstrual period, adding confusion when discussing from the fetus's perspective.
- **Stages of Prenatal Development 产前发育**:
    
    - **Germinal Stage** (0-2 weeks post-conception 受孕后) 生殖阶段:
        - Begins with fertilization, leading to cell division and formation of a blastocyst which implants in the uterine wall 子宫壁.
        - Risks include ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage. 风险包括异位妊娠和流产
    - **Embryonic Stage** (2-8 weeks post-conception) 胚胎阶段:
        - Major organ systems develop, following the cephalocaudal and proximodistal principles.
        - Development of supporting structures like the placenta and umbilical cord.
        - Critical period for organogenesis, highly susceptible to teratogens.
    - **Fetal Stage** (8 weeks to birth) 胎儿阶段:
        - Growth and maturation of body parts established in the embryonic stage.
        - Key developments include the formation of fingerprints, nails, and significant brain development in the last weeks.
- **Miscarriage vs. Stillbirth 流产 vs 死胎**:
    
    - **Miscarriage**: Loss before 20 weeks, often underreported.
    - **Stillbirth**: Fetal death after 20 weeks, less common but significant.
- **Birth Defects 出生缺陷** : Affect 3% of US births, including neural tube defects and congenital heart defects, often preventable with prenatal care.
    

### **Prenatal Screening, Diagnosis, & Treatment**

- **Low Risk Pregnancy**:
    
    - **Ultrasound**: Used to confirm pregnancy and monitor development, no risk to the fetus.
    - **Maternal Blood Screening**: Can detect various conditions early in pregnancy.
- **High Risk Pregnancy**:
    
    - **CVS**: For older mothers or those with previous genetic issues, involves a small risk of miscarriage.
    - **Amniocentesis**: More invasive, used to detect neural tube defects.
    - **Fetal Echocardiography**: Detailed ultrasound for heart defects.
- **Abnormal Findings**: Depending on the condition, options might include termination, fetal therapy (gene therapy, medication, surgery), or monitoring.
    

### **Prenatal Influences**

- Factors like nutrition (especially in the first trimester), drugs/alcohol, medication, caffeine, disease, stress, environmental hazards, and paternal health can influence prenatal development.
