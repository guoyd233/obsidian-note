### **Genetics**

- **Genetics & the Human Genome**:
    
    - Genetic information is fundamental to all life forms.
    - **Chromosomes**: Structures containing DNA, which is composed of sequences of four bases forming unique instructions.
    - **Genes**: Segments of DNA on chromosomes that carry hereditary information.
    - **Mitosis**: Process of DNA duplication leading to cell division, creating identical cells.
    - **Chromosome Count**: Varies across species (e.g., humans have 46 chromosomes in 23 pairs, including sex chromosomes).
    - **Meiosis**: Process leading to the formation of sex cells, allowing for genetic variation in offspring.
- **Genetics & Disease**:
    
    - Hereditary diseases can be congenital, requiring one dominant gene (e.g., Huntingtonâ€™s) or two recessive genes (e.g., Tay-Sachs).
    - Complex traits like personality or intelligence involve multifactorial transmission, where genes interact with environmental factors.
    - Identical twins can exhibit differences due to this gene-environment interaction.

### **Conception**

- **Female Pelvic Anatomy**: Overview provided, highlighting the presence of immature eggs in ovaries from birth.
- **Fertilization**: Begins at puberty when eggs mature and ovulate.
- **Infertility**: Defined as the inability to conceive after 12 months of unprotected sex, with earlier referral after age 35. About 6% of married women in the US face this issue.
- **Pregnancy Loss**: Approximately one-quarter of pregnancies end in loss.

### **Fertility Treatments**

- **Testing**: Involves checking sperm quality, hormone levels, genetics, and physical conditions in both males and females.
- **Treatments**:
    - For males: Medications or lifestyle changes.
    - For females: Fertility medications, ICSI, IUI, surgical interventions, and IVF which involves hyperovulation, egg retrieval, fertilization in a dish, and embryo transfer or freezing.
