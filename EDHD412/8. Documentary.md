The first fact is how a baby's brain, despite it is so small, contains billions of neurons and trillions of connections. This is interesting because it shows how compact and efficient the brain is. Even though it's small, it has an incredible capacity to store memories, and generate emotions. It makes me realize how much development happens even before birth.

Another fact is that the brain continues to develop throughout life, not just during infancy. This is interesting because our brain can adapt themselves in response to new experiences throughout life. This development gives hope for lifelong learning, showing that we're always capable of growth and change.

Another interesting fact is the advancement of modern technology. For example, there are premature babies who missed critical periods of brain development, making them more sensitive to external environments. However, modern medicine can now largely save these babies' lives, and their brains can still develop rapidly. This makes me realize the resilience of life. Even under such adverse conditions, the baby can still achieve healthy growth through themselves and medical assistance.

I wonder what factors determine which neural connections are preserved and which are eliminated during development?

Why can't neurons reproduce like other cells in our body?

I'd be interested in learning more about how babies form their memories. Since most people can't remember anything at that time, I want to know why this happens.
