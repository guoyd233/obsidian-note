### **Physical Growth**

- **Measuring Growth**: Utilization of growth charts to track and predict growth.
    
    - **Historical Context**: Original NCHS charts from 1977 were criticized for lack of diversity; now replaced by more inclusive CDC charts.
    - **Growth Charts Video**: A resource to understand how growth charts are used.
- **Failure to Thrive (FTT)**: Condition where an infant's growth does not meet expected standards, often due to inadequate nutrition.
    

### **Brain Development**

- **Measurement**: Some brain development is **experience-expectant**, where structures are prepared to develop upon receiving certain stimuli (e.g., walking, visual perception).
- **Stimulation**: Early experiences are vital for brain development. **Experience-dependent** changes occur based on specific exposures (e.g., learning music or skating).
- **Maltreatment & the Brain**: Includes neglect, physical, sexual, or psychological abuse, often by close family members. Abusive Head Trauma (formerly Shaken Baby Syndrome) is highlighted as a severe form of maltreatment.
- **Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)**: Discussion on how ACEs impact development.

### **Health & Safety**

- **Newborn Screening**: Tests for conditions not detectable prenatally via a blood prick.
- **Lead Poisoning**: Regular screenings during infancy to prevent and detect lead exposure.
- **Vaccines, Injuries, & Illnesses**:
    - Infants typically experience 7-8 colds per year from 6 months to 5 years.
    - **Vaccines**: Discussion on history, herd immunity, and regulations.
    - **Injuries**: Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death for children aged 1-4; babyproofing is crucial.
- **Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)**: Unexplained death in infants under 1 year, peaking at 2-4 months. Emphasis on safe sleep practices.

### **Nutrition & Feeding**

- **Breast Milk**: Preferred for its nutritional and immune benefits, also beneficial for the mother (e.g., oxytocin release, calorie burning). Recommended for at least 6 months.
- **Breastfeeding Rates**: Comparatively low in the US versus other countries.
