### EDHD 306: Spring 2025 - Ethical Research Summary

**Quick Review:**
- **What makes a strong theory?** A strong theory should account for data, have explanatory relevance, be testable, predict novel events, and be parsimonious.
- **Two aspects of a strong research question:** It should be testable and specific.
- **Difference between a hypothesis and a prediction:** A hypothesis is a tentative statement to be tested, while a prediction is a specific expectation based on that hypothesis.
- **Why do we have guidelines for ethical research?** To protect participants from harm, ensure fairness, respect autonomy, and maintain integrity in research.

**Class Schedule:**
1. **APA Guidelines for Ethical Research:** 
   - **Principle A: Beneficence and Nonmaleficence** - Maximize benefits, minimize harms.
   - **Principle B: Fidelity and Responsibility** - Uphold trust, provide credit/compensation, protect confidentiality.
   - **Principle C: Integrity** - Ensure accuracy, honesty, and truthfulness.
   - **Principle D: Justice** - Fair distribution of research costs and benefits.
   - **Principle E: Respect for People’s Rights and Dignity** - Respect autonomy, protect vulnerable populations, ensure informed consent.

2. **IRB at the University of Maryland:** Reviews research to balance costs and benefits, categorizes research based on risk, and ensures adherence to APA principles.

3. **Historical Context for Ethics:**
   - **Tuskegee Experiment (1932-1972)**, **Milgram Experiment (1963)**, **Stanford Prison Experiment (1971)** highlighted the need for ethical guidelines.
   - **The Belmont Report (1979)** established key principles: Beneficence, Respect for Persons, and Justice.

**Ethics Activity:**
- **Scenario I:** Conducting research before IRB approval and misrepresenting the review status.
- **Scenario II:** Fabricating data for a conference abstract with the intention to verify later.
- **Scenario III:** Using class grades to assess the impact of an instructional video without additional consent.
- **Scenario IV:** Measuring caregiver stress response without inducing crying but instructing them to ignore natural baby sounds.
- **Scenario V:** Deceiving participants about the study's true purpose (studying conformity under the guise of perception).

**Ensuring Ethical Research:**
- **Institutional Review Board (IRB):** Reviews research proposals, categorizes them (Exempt, Expedited, Full Board), and ensures ethical compliance.

Key terms:

- **The Belmont Report**: A seminal document in the field of research ethics, published in 1979, which outlines the basic ethical principles and guidelines for protecting human subjects in research. It established three core principles: Beneficence, Respect for Persons, and Justice.

- **American Psychological Association Code of Ethics**: A set of ethical guidelines established by the APA to guide psychologists in their professional conduct, particularly in research. It includes principles like Beneficence and Nonmaleficence, Fidelity and Responsibility, Integrity, Justice, and Respect for People’s Rights and Dignity.

- **Beneficence & Nonmaleficence**: The principle that researchers should maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harms. Beneficence involves doing good, while nonmaleficence involves avoiding harm.

- **Fidelity & Responsibility**: This principle emphasizes the importance of establishing trust with research participants, fulfilling implicit promises (like being present, providing credit or compensation, and protecting confidentiality), and taking responsibility for one's actions in research.

- **Integrity**: Refers to the commitment to accuracy, honesty, and truthfulness in all aspects of research, including the reporting of data. It involves avoiding deception, maintaining transparency, and ensuring the integrity of the research process.

- **Justice**: This principle addresses the fair distribution of the burdens and benefits of research. It ensures that all groups have equal access to participate in research and to benefit from its outcomes, avoiding exploitation or discrimination.

- **Respect for People’s Rights and Dignity**: This principle underscores the importance of treating participants as autonomous agents capable of making their own decisions. It includes obtaining informed consent, protecting the rights of vulnerable populations like children, and respecting privacy and confidentiality.

- **Institutional Review Board (IRB)**: A committee that reviews, approves, and monitors research involving human subjects to ensure ethical standards are met. The IRB assesses the balance of risks and benefits, ensures informed consent, and protects participant rights.

- **Exempt Review**: A category of IRB review for research activities that present no more than minimal risk to human subjects and meet specific criteria, allowing them to be exempt from some regulatory requirements, including the need for formal consent.

- **Expedited Review**: A process where research proposals that involve no more than minimal risk and fit within specific categories can be reviewed and approved more quickly by the IRB, without needing a full board meeting.

- **Full Board Review**: The most comprehensive level of IRB review, required for research that involves more than minimal risk to participants. It involves a convened meeting of the full IRB to discuss and vote on the approval of the research proposal.

- **Consent Form**: A document provided to research participants that outlines the study's purpose, procedures, potential risks and benefits, confidentiality measures, and their rights, including the right to withdraw from the study at any time. It is crucial for obtaining informed consent.


- **贝尔蒙特报告（The Belmont Report）**：1979年发布的关于研究伦理的重要文件，概述了保护人类受试者的基本伦理原则和指导方针。它确立了三个核心原则：仁爱、尊重个人和公正。

- **美国心理学会伦理准则（American Psychological Association Code of Ethics）**：由APA制定的伦理指南，旨在指导心理学家在专业行为中，特别是在研究中的行为准则。包括仁爱与无害、忠诚与责任、诚信、公正和尊重人的权利与尊严等原则。

- **仁爱与无害（Beneficence & Nonmaleficence）**：研究者应最大化可能的利益并最小化可能的伤害的原则。仁爱涉及做好事，而无害涉及避免伤害。

- **忠诚与责任（Fidelity & Responsibility）**：强调与研究参与者建立信任的重要性，履行隐含的承诺（如在场、提供信用或补偿、保护隐私），并对研究中的行为负责。

- **诚信（Integrity）**：指在研究的所有方面，包括数据报告中，承诺准确性、诚实和真实性。涉及避免欺骗，保持透明，并确保研究过程的完整性。

- **公正（Justice）**：涉及公平分配研究的负担和利益的原则。确保所有群体都有平等的机会参与研究并从其结果中受益，避免剥削或歧视。

- **尊重人的权利和尊严（Respect for People’s Rights and Dignity）**：强调将参与者视为能够自己做决定的自主代理人的重要性。包括获得知情同意，保护弱势群体如儿童的权利，以及尊重隐私和保密性。

- **机构审查委员会（Institutional Review Board, IRB）**：一个审查、批准和监督涉及人类受试者研究的委员会，以确保符合伦理标准。IRB评估风险和利益的平衡，确保知情同意，并保护参与者的权利。

- **豁免审查（Exempt Review）**：IRB审查的一种类别，适用于对人类受试者风险不超过最低限度的研究活动，并符合特定标准，允许它们免除一些监管要求，包括正式同意的需要。

- **快速审查（Expedited Review）**：一种流程，适用于涉及不超过最低风险且符合特定类别的研究提案，可以由IRB更快地审查和批准，无需召开全委员会会议。

- **全委员会审查（Full Board Review）**：IRB审查的最全面的级别，适用于对参与者风险超过最低限度的研究。需要召开全IRB会议来讨论和投票批准研究提案。

- **同意书（Consent Form）**：提供给研究参与者的文件，概述了研究的目的、程序、潜在风险和利益、保密措施以及他们的权利，包括随时退出研究的权利。对于获得知情同意至关重要。
